### Hi there 👋

My name is Ahoo Wang.

I'm a systems architect and builder, deeply passionate about the intersection of **LLMs, Agentic AI, and scalable distributed systems**. My current focus is on designing the next generation of intelligent systems, from foundational research to production-ready platforms.

**🤖 AI & Agent Focus**
- **Research & Design:** Leading the design and research of next-generation **Agent Orchestration Engines**.
- **Platform Development:** Recently developed an **Intelligent Agent Orchestration Platform** from the ground up.

**🧱 Core Technical Stack**
- **Languages:** Java/Kotlin, C#, Python, TypeScript
- **Infrastructure & Data:** Kubernetes, BigData ecosystems
- **Architecture:** Distributed systems, Event-Driven Architectures (EDA), Domain-Driven Design (DDD), CQRS, Event Sourcing

**🔭 Current Main Project**
I'm actively building **[Wow](https://github.com/Ahoo-Wang/Wow)** – a modern, distributed application framework designed to support the development of complex, event-driven systems and agentic workflows.

**🌱 Continuous Learning**
Deepening expertise in **Advanced DDD, Event-Sourced Architectures, and Reactive patterns** to better model and implement sophisticated AI agent behaviors and interactions.

**📫 Let's Connect**
- Email: ahoowang@qq.com
- I'm open to discussions about **LLM/Agent architecture, system design, and challenging engineering problems.**
